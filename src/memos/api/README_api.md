# MemOS API

## Default entry and deployment

- Use **`server_api.py`** as the API service entry for **public open-source usage**.
- You can deploy via **`docker/Dockerfile`**.

The above is the default, general way to run and deploy the API.

## Extensions and reference implementations

- **`server_api_ext.py`** and **`Dockerfile.krolik`** are one developer’s extended API and deployment setup, **for reference only**. They are not yet integrated with cloud services and are still in testing.
- If you need extensions or custom behavior, you can refer to these and use or adapt them as you like.
